# Overview

This document is a quick-start guide on how to install Braiins OS on your mining device.
There are two ways how to test and use Braiins OS:

1. **Boot from SD card** with Braiins OS image, effectively keeping the stock firmware in the built-in flash memory. In case you encounter any issues, you can simply boot the stock firmware from the internal memory. This is a safe way we suggest to start with.

2. **Permanently reflash the stock firmware**, effectively replacing the manufacturer’s firmware completely with Braiins OS. In this method, the only way how to go back to the default stock setup is to restore the manufacturer’s firmware from a backup that you create during install.

Due to the aforementioned reasons, it is highly recommended to install Braiins OS firmware **only on devices with SD card slots**.

You will need:

* supported ASIC miner (see the list below)
* computer with Linux or Windows
* SD card (optional but recommended method)

*Note: Commands used in this manual are instructional. You might need to adjust file paths and names adequately.*

# Braiins OS Versioning Scheme

Each release contains a version number that consists of YYYY-MM-DD-P, where:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| YYYY | 4 digit release year |
| MM | 2 digit month |
| DD | 2 digit day number |
| P | single digit patch level - in case there was a hotfix re-release on the same day |

The version number is also encoded in all artifacts that are available for download.

In addition to the above, each major Braiins OS release has a code name (e.g. wolfram, cobalt, etc.).

## Transitional firmwares

The table below outlines correspondence between transitional firmware image archives (as provided at [https://feeds.braiins-os.org/](https://feeds.braiins-os.org/)) and a particular hardware type.

| Firmware prefix | Hardware |
| --- | --- |
| braiins-os_am1-s9_*.tar.bz2 | Antminer S9, S9i, S9j; (**R4** support is **broken** do not **USE**!!) |
| braiins-os_dm1-g9_*.tar.bz2 | Dragon Mint T1 with G9 control board |
| braiins-os_dm1-g19_*.tar.bz2 | Dragon Mint T1 with G19 control board |

# Installing Braiins OS for the First Time (Replacing Factory Firmware with Braiins OS)

The steps described below need to be done only **the very first time** you are installing Braiins OS on a device. You will be using so-called *transitional firmware images* mentioned above for this purpose.

## Initial Steps

Download the latest released transitional firmware images + signatures from: [https://feeds.braiins-os.org/](https://feeds.braiins-os.org/)


You can check the downloaded file for its authenticity and integrity. The image signature can be verified by [GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/):

```bash
gpg2 --search-keys release@braiins.cz
for i in ./braiins-os_*asc; do gpg2 --verify $i; done
```

You should see something like:

```
gpg: assuming signed data in './braiins-os_am1-s9_2018-10-24-0-9e5687a2.tar.bz2'
.
.
gpg: Good signature from "Braiins Systems Release Key (Key used for signing software made by Braiins Systems) <release@braiins.cz>" [ultimate]
```

Unpack the selected (or all) transitional firmware images using standard file archiver software (e.g. 7-Zip, WinRAR) or the following command (Linux):

```bash
for i in  ./braiins-os_*.tar.bz2; do tar xvjf $i; done
```

### Transitional firmware image types

The table below explains the use of individual transitional firmware images

| Firmware prefix | Hardware |
| --- | --- |
| braiins-os_HARDWARE_TYPE_**sd**_VERSION.img | SD card image for testing on hardware, recovering a *bricked* machine etc. |
| braiins-os_HARDWARE_TYPE_**ssh**_VERSION.tar.bz2 | transitional firmware for upgrading from factory firmware that has **ssh** access |
| braiins-os_HARDWARE_TYPE_**telnet**_VERSION.tar.bz2 | transitional firmware for upgrading from factory firmware that provides **telnet** access |
| braiins-os_HARDWARE_TYPE_**web**_VERSION.{vendor specific extension} | transitional firmware for upgrading from factory firmware via the **factory firmware web interface**. The exact file extension depends on particular hardware type |


## Phase 1: Creating Bootable SD Card Image (Antminer S9 example)

Insert an empty SD card (with a minimum capacity of 32 MB) into your computer and flash the image onto the SD card.

### Using software with GUI (Windows, Linux)

* [Download](https://etcher.io/) and run Etcher
* Select the sd.img image
* Select drive (SD card)
* Copy the image to SD card by clicking on *Flash!*


### Using bash (Linux)

Identify SD cards block device (e.g. by ```lsblk```) and run the following commands (replace ```VERSION``` with the current latest release):

```
sudo dd if=braiins-os_am1-s9_sd_VERSION.img of=/dev/your-sd-card-block-device
sync
```

### Adjusting MAC Address
If you know the MAC address of your device, mount the SD card and adjust the MAC address. in ```uEnv.txt``` (most desktop Linux systems have automount capabilities once you reinsert the card into your reader). The ```uEnv.txt``` is environment for the bootloader and resides in the first (FAT) partition of the SD card. That way, once the device boots with Braiins OS, it would have the same IP address as it had with the factory firmware.

### Booting the Device from SD Card
- Unmount the SD card
- Adjust jumper to boot from SD card (instead of NAND memory):
   - [Antminer S9](s9)
   - [Dragon Mint T1](dm1)
- Insert it into the device, start the device.
- After a moment, you should be able to access Braiins OS interface on device IP address.


## Phase 2: Permanently Migrating from Factory Firmware to Braiins OS

Once the SD card works, it is very safe to attempt flashing the built-in flash memory as there will always be a way to recover the factory firmware.
Follow the steps below. The tool creates a backup of the original firmware in the ```backup``` folder. It is important to **keep the backup safe** to resolve any potential future issues.

*Note: You have to have Python 3 installed to migrate to Braiins OS and run all the `*.py` scripts. [Follow this guide to install Python 3.](python-install)*

Below are commands to replace original factory firmware with Braiins OS using the SSH variant. The tool attempts to login to the machine via SSH, therefore you may be prompted for a password.

### Using Linux

```bash
cd braiins-os_am1-s9_ssh_VERSION
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 .env
source .env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 upgrade2bos.py your-miner-hostname-or-ip
```

### Using macOS

```bash
cd braiins-os_am1-s9_ssh_VERSION

# create environment
# replace xxx with the decimal version of the installed Python
virtualenv .venv3 -p /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.xxx/bin/python3.xxx

. venv3/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 upgrade2bos.py your-miner-hostname-or-ip
```

### Using Windows

```bash
cd braiins-os_am1-s9_ssh_VERSION

# create bos environment if it does not exist
mkvirtualenv bos
setprojectdir .

# select bos environment if it has been created already
workon bos

pip install -r requirements.txt

python upgrade2bos.py your-miner-hostname-or-ip
deactivate
```

### Adding a post-upgrade script

There is an option `--post-upgrade` to run a custom post upgrade script.

```
python3 upgrade2bos.py your-miner-hostname-or-ip --post-upgrade path-to-directory-with-script
```

The directory with post-upgrade script must contain stage3.sh which is run after miner successful upgrade. This directory can contain other files which can be accessed from the stage3.sh in the scope of the current directory when the script is run.

#### Example script (change default login)

The content of `stage3.sh`:

```
#!/bin/sh

# set new password for web interface
echo -e "[newpassword]\n[newpassword]" | passwd

# disable SSH password authentication
uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].PasswordAuth='off'
uci set dropbear.@dropbear[0].RootPasswordAuth='off'
uci commit dropbear

# copy SSH authorized keys for password-less login
cp ./authorized_keys /etc/dropbear/
```

The content of `authorized_keys` is in a standard format specified by Dropbear or OpenSSH server. The keys can be obtained from the local machine:

```
cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ./authorized_keys
```

# Basic user's guide

## Miner Signalization (LED)

Miner LED signalization depends on its operational mode. There are two modes (*recovery* and *normal*) which are signaled by the **green** and **red LED** on the front panel. The LED on the control board (inside) always shows *heartbeat* (flashes at a load average based rate).

### Recovery Mode

The recovery mode is signaled by **flashing green LED** (50 ms on, 950 ms off) on the front panel. The **red LED** represents access to a NAND
disk and flashing during factory reset when data is written to NAND.

### Normal Mode

The normal mode state is signaled by the combination of the front panel **red** and **green LED** as specified in the table below:

| red LED | green LED | meaning |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| on | off | *cgminer* or *cgminer_monitor* are not running |
| slow flashing | off | hash rate is below 80% of expected hash rate or the miner cannot connect to any pool (all pools are dead) |
| off | very slow flashing (1 sec on, 1 sec off) | *miner* is operational and hash rate above 80 % of expected hash rate |
| fast flashing | N/A | LED override requested by user (`miner fault_light on`) |

### Identifying a miner in a farm

The local miner utility can also be used to identify a particular device by enabling aggressive blinking of **red LED**:

```bash
$ miner fault_light on
```

Similarly to disable the LED run:

```bash
$ miner fault_light off
```

## Fan control

Braiins OS supports automatic fan control for both T1 and S9 miners (using [PID controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controll)). The fan controller can operate in one of two modes:

- **Automatic Fan Control** - Miner software tries to regulate the fan speed so that miner temperature is approximately at target temperature (which can be configured). Allowed temperature range is 30-90 degree Celsius.
- **Fixed fan speed** - Fans are kept at a fixed, user-defined speed, no matter the temperature. This is useful if you have your own way of cooling the miner or if the temperature sensors don't work. Allowed fan speed is 0%-100%.

The fan control mode can be inspected in "Miner Stats" page and changed in "Miner Configuration" page.

**Warning**: mis-configuring fans (either turning them off or at low level, or setting target temperature too high) may irreversibly **DAMAGE** your miner.

The default behavior for fan control is to be in "Automatic Fan Control" mode with reasonably set target temperature. The number and type of temperature sensors is different on T1 and S9, but in general the "measured temperature" is maximum of temperatures from all sensors.

### Fan operation

1. On miner start fan is set to 100% no matter the configuration (this is to prevent overheating during initialization)
2. Once temperature sensors are initialized, fancontrol is enabled. If temperature sensors are not working or they read out temperature of 0, fans are set to full speed.
3. If the current mode is "fixed fan speed", fan is set to given speed.
4. If the current mode is "automatic fan control", the fan is regulated by temperature. For the first 2 minutes the minimum fan speed is set to 60% (to wait for the miner to warm up), then the minimum speed is 10%.
5. In case miner temperature is above *HOT temperature*, fans are set to 100% (even in "fixed fan speed" mode).
6. In case miner temperature is above *Dangerous temperature*, cgminer shuts down (even in "fixed fan speed" mode).

### Default temperature limits

Miner type | Default Target Temperature | *HOT temperature* | *Dangerous temperature*
--- | --- | --- | ---
S9 | 75&deg;C | 90&deg;C | 95&deg;C
T1 | 89&deg;C | 95&deg;C | 105&deg;C


### Fan Control configuration in `cgminer.conf`

There are three new configuration statements: `fan-mode` which selects which mode to use, `fan-temp` which sets temperature (in degree Celsius, and is valid only when `fan-mode: "temp"`), and `fan-speed` which sets speed of fan (in percent).

```
fan-mode: "temp"
fan-temp: "75"
```

```
fan-mode: "speed"
fan-speed: "90"
```

## AsicBoost support

Braiins OS supports overt (version-rolling) AsicBoost in accordance with [BIP310](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0310.mediawiki).

Trying to use AsicBoost on a pool that is not supporting it will result in an error message (the device will not start mining at all). Please note there is no automatic detection present at the moment, meaning AsicBoost can be only turned on/off manually.

### Antminer S9

AsicBoost is **turned on by default**. This setting can be changed in:

- web interface Services > CGMiner menu
- config file ```/etc/cgminer.conf``` by altering the ```multi-version``` value to `1` (disabled) or `4` (enabled)

### DragonMint T1

AsicBoost is **turned on by default** and **can not be turned off**. The device is incapable of mining efficiently without AsicBoost.

## Migrating from Braiins OS to factory firmware

Restoring the original factory firmware requires issuing the command below. Please, note that the previously created backup needs to be available.

- Run (*on Windows, use `python` command instead of `python3`*):

```bash
python3 restore2factory.py backup/backup-id-date/ your-miner-hostname-or-ip
```

## Recovering Bricked (unbootable) Devices Using SD Card

If anything goes wrong and your device seems unbootable, you can use the previously created SD card image to recover original firmware from the  manufacturer:

- Follow the steps in *Creating Bootable SD Card Image* to boot the device
- Run (*on Windows, use `python` command instead of `python3`*):
```
cd braiins-os_am1-s9_ssh_VERSION
python3 restore2factory.py backup/2ce9c4aab53c-2018-09-19/ your-miner-hostname-or-ip
```

After the script finishes, wait a few minutes and adjust jumper to boot from NAND (internal memory) afterward.

## Firmware upgrade

Firmware upgrade process uses standard mechanism for installing/upgrading software packages within any OpenWrt based system. Follow the steps below to perform the firmware upgrade.

### Upgrade via web interface

- Update the repository information by clicking on *Update lists* button in the System > Software menu. In case the button is missing, the system has to be rebooted!
- Once done, proceed to update the ```firmware``` package.

### Upgrade via SSH

```bash
# download latest packages from feeds server
$ opkg update
# try to upgrade to the latest firmware
$ opkg install firmware
```

Since the firmware installation results in a reboot, the following output is expected:

```
root@MINER:~# opkg install firmware

### Upgrade from Braiins OS preview version

The script *bos2bos.py* (available in the repository, [clone it first](#cloning-the-braiins-os-repository)) is provided to upgrade from one of the Braiins OS preview versions and expects two parameters: URL to the transitional firmware (please refer to this [table](#transitional-firmwares)) and hostname or IP of the miner. You can also set up a new MAC address using the option `--mac`.

Follow the below steps to upgrade/transition from the Braiins OS preview.

```bash
python3 bos2bos.py transitional-firmware-url your-miner-hostname-or-ip
```

If you wish to upload configuration using a yml file, use the `--config` option.

```bash
python3 bos2bos.py --config miner_cfg.yml transitional-firmware-url your-miner-hostname-or-ip
```

Here is a `miner_cfg.yml` config template you can modify according to your needs:

```
miner:
  # miner HW identifier
  hwid: Q50QDhdWuWq9yDr5
  # default miner pool
  pool:
    host: stratum+tcp://stratum.slushpool.com
    port: 3333
    user: '!non-existent-user!'
    pass: x
  # HW specific settings
  hw:
    freq: 550
    fixed_freq: true

net:
  # default miner MAC address
  mac: 00:0A:35:FF:FF:FF
  # static IP settings
  ip: 10.33.0.2
  mask: 255.255.255.0
  gateway: 10.33.0.1
  dns_servers:
  - 10.33.0.1
  # miner hostname when DHCP is used (static IP is not set)
  hostname: bos-miner
```

## Network miner discovery

The script *discover.py* (available in the repository, [clone it first](#cloning-the-braiins-os-repository)) is to be used to discover supported mining devices in the local network. For each device, the output includes MAC address, IP address, system info, hostname, and a mining username configured.

The parameter is expected to include a list of IP addresses or IP subnetwork with a mask (example below) to scan a whole subnetwork.

```bash
python3 discover.py 10.55.0.0/24

50:6c:be:08:52:e5 (10.55.0.117) | bOS dm1-g19_2018-11-27-0-c34516b0 [nand] {511524 KiB RAM} dhcp(miner-w1) @userName.worker1
00:6c:aa:23:52:e1 (10.55.0.102) | DragonMint T1 G19 {250564 KiB RAM} dhcp(dragonMint) @userName.worker2
00:7e:92:77:a0:ca (10.55.0.133) | bOS am1-s9_2018-11-27-0-c34516b0 [nand] {1015120 KiB RAM} dhcp(miner-w3) @userName.worker3
00:94:cb:12:a0:ce (10.55.0.145) | Antminer S9 Fri Nov 17 17:57:49 CST 2017 (S9_V2.55) {1015424 KiB RAM} dhcp(antMiner) @userName.worker5
```

## Batch migration to Braiins OS

You can use simple bash scripts to install Braiins OS on a larger number of devices in sequence. For example, the following snippet will install selected transitional image to all supported devices in the local network and print out their IP addresses.

```
IP_PREFIX=192.168.0; for i in `seq 1 150`; do ip=${IP_PREFIX}.$i; python3 ./upgrade2bos.py $ip || {echo Last IP processed: $ip}; done
```

For batch migration, you may also consider disabling backups with the `--no-nand-backup` option to speed up the process and save storage space. If you use this option, only config files will be backed up from each device.

## Setting miner password via SSH

You can set the miners password via SSH from a remote host by running the below command and replacing *[newpassword]* with your own password.

*Note: bOS does **not** keep a history of the commands executed.*

```bash
$ ssh root@[miner-hostname-or-ip] 'echo -e "[newpassword]\n[newpassword]" | passwd'
```

To do this for several hosts in parallel you could use [p-ssh](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pssh).

## Reset to initial Braiins OS version

Uninstall the current firmware package to downgrade your firmware to the version which was initially installed when replacing the stock firmware.

```bash
$ opkg remove firmware
```

In addition to the above, reset to initial Braiins OS version can also be initiated as follows:

* *IP SET button* - hold it for *10s* until red LED flashes
* *SD card* - first partition with FAT contains file *uEnv.txt* with a line **factory_reset=yes**
* *miner utility* - call ```miner factory_reset``` from the miner's command line

## Recovery Mode

Users doesn't have to typically enter recovery mode while using Braiins OS in a standard way. The ```bos2factory.py``` downgrade process uses it to restore the original factory firmware from the manufacturer. It can also be useful when repairing/investigating the currently installed system.

The recovery mode can be invoked in different ways:

* *IP SET button* - hold it for *3s* until green LED flashes
* *SD card* - first partition with FAT contains file *uEnv.txt* with a line **recovery=yes**
* *miner utility* - call ```miner run_recovery``` from the miner's command line

## Cloning the Braiins OS repository

Some Python tools/scripts are not included in the releases so you will need to clone the repository and set up the environment (if not already) to use them.

```bash
# clone repository
git clone https://github.com/braiins/braiins-os.git

cd braiins-os
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 .env
source .env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*If you want to build Braiins OS yourself or modify the code, see the complete [developer guide](https://github.com/braiins/braiins-os).*
